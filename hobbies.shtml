                <h2> Workout </h2>
                <p> I really like to workout. Working out is useful because can help improving your physical health by
                    strengthening your muscles, bones, and cardiovascular system. Regular exercise can also lower your
                    risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Secondly, working out can
                    have a positive impact on your mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>

                <h2> Videogames </h2>
                <p> Since a kid I have always ejoyed playing all kind of videogames. My favorite is The Witcher, I
                    played all the games and read some books. I love everything about it. video games can be a great way
                    to relax and unwind after a long day. They offer a fun and engaging activity that can help take your
                    mind off stressors and provide a temporary escape from reality. Secondly, playing video games can
                    provide cognitive benefits such as improved problem-solving, decision-making, and spatial reasoning
                    skills. Many games require players to think strategically and use critical thinking, which can be
                    beneficial in real-world situations. </p>

                <h2> Traveling </h2>
                <p> A new hobbie that I've been doing on the last few years is traveling, althoug is bit expensive is
                    totally worth it. When you travel, you get the opportunity to experience new cultures, try new
                    foods, and learn about different ways of life. It can broaden your perspective on the world and help
                    you appreciate the diversity of our planet.</p>
