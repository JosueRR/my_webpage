# _Design_
The specifics of the design can be found in the directory called design. The idea of the web site is to have a minimalist look, also I used colors such as lime and dark grey because I like them. The images are SVG free files. The one you see in the home page is a Viking because I like Nordic culture.

All the code is modularized in sections. The SSI is used for the navegation bar.
